Back-End Development
• Languages: Go (Golang), JavaScript.
• Frameworks/Libraries: Go net/http, Gin, Node.js, SpringBoot.
• Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis (lib/pq, Sequelize, TypeORM, Time-series)
• Tools: Git, Docker, RESTful APIs, JSON, Swagger, Go modules
• Testing: Go testing, JUnit.
• CI/CD: K8s, AWS CloudWatch, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Grafana.

Developed a FullStack Application (SPA) for international roaming call routing, utilizing both
Micro Frontend and monolithic architectures with NX workspace (Angular) and advanced
TypeScript features (interfaces, generics, type assertions) for strict typing discipline along
with database design, transaction management, and isolation levels for consistent
and reliable data operations in production.
• Tech Stack: TypeScript, Angular, NX, Node.js, GoLang, PostgreSQL, Swagger,
Highcharts, Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, RxJS, Next.js.
• Built high-performance RESTful APIs using Go net/http with clean architecture (handlers → services → repositories) and PostgreSQL connection pooling for scalable backend services(Backend).
• Designed database schema with DBML, implemented transaction management and isolation levels, optimized SQL queries with prepared statements for performance(Backend).
• Developed Go backend with graceful shutdown, request/response timeouts (15s read/write, 60s idle), goroutine-based concurrency, and structured logging middleware(Backend).
• Secured APIs with user authentication, JWT and PASETO tokens, implemented OAuth2 authentication, and provided comprehensive Swagger documentation(Backend).
• Implemented reactive programming using RxJS (Observables, Observers, Subscriptions,
Subjects, event-driven logic) and authentication services with Keycloak, JWT, module
federation, and dependency injection(Frontend).
• Created highly scalable, responsive charts, graphs, and maps using Highcharts, AgGrid,
and Material UI components(Frontend).
• Develop Docker image for deployment with Docker-compose , Github Action to
automatically build and deploy app to AWS Kubernetes cluster.
